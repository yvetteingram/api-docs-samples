# 🌤️ OpenWeatherMap API Documentation (Sample Project)

This repository showcases a **sample API documentation project** created using **Markdown** and published with **GitHub Pages**.  
It demonstrates my ability to combine **technical writing**, **programming**, and **developer education** into clear, structured documentation.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project documents the [OpenWeatherMap REST API](https://openweathermap.org/api), a public API that provides weather data for any location worldwide.  
The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate how I approach **docs-as-code** workflows — writing documentation that lives alongside code and can be version-controlled.

**Key Features:**
- Developer-friendly Markdown documentation  
- REST API endpoint reference tables  
- Example requests in `curl`, Python, and Node.js  
- Error handling and best practices section  
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages** for public access
